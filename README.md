# Heroes

This app shows your favourite Star Wars characters. You can click on them and see their details. You can use the menu to navigate between screens and heroes.

## Features to implement

1. Sign-in

A sign-in view. Needs username and password inputs as well as a sign-in button. Make the password field hide any characters that get entered.

2. Menu

Make a side menu with some nav links. (Hint: ionic2 has a menu ui component you should probably use.) For the links, use the ones in the wireframe, or make up your own.

3. Master List

This should be a list of item cards. (H: Also ionic2 ui components). We don't want these to be hard-coded somewhere, we want them to be populated from some kind of store/backend. The cards for the items can look like what you want, but they need to be able to display a picture, a title, and some details or text from the item. Feel free to add some elements to the cards, e.g. upvote/downvote-buttons or badges, but they aren't at all necessary.

4. Detail

This is a detail view for the item selected. It is primarily just a bigger version of the item's card from the master list view. It should display the picture from the card, but the picture should bigger. It should have the title, but bigger. It should have the details from the card, but more or all of them. Include a button that takes you back to the master list view.

5. Chat(bonus)

If and only if you have free time and really feel the need to show off, take your best shot at making a chat view too.
